The best way to use MySQL on Railsonfire is to provide a separate database file that configures your app for MySQL and is copied to config/database.yml before executing any database operation.

You can download a database file for [MySQL.](/files/rof-mysql-database.yml)
Simply copy the file you need to your config directory and add

    cp -f config/rof-mysql-database.yml config/database.yml

to your railsonfire.yml file before any interaction with the database.

You need to add the mysql2 gem to your Gemfile. By adding

    gem 'mysql2' unless ENV["RAILSONFIRE"].nil?

you can install the gems only when you are on Railsonfire.
