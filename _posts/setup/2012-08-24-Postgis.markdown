Setting up PostGIS on Railsonfire is extremely simple. All you need to
do is add the ***activerecord-postgis-adapter*** gem to your Gemfile.

Make sure you follow the setup steps outlined by the
[activerecord-postgis-adapter](https://github.com/dazuma/activerecord-postgis-adapter#installation-and-configuration)
including requiring its railtie. Try running ***bundle exec rake
db:create*** locally before to make sure everything works out fine.

Additionally in your railsonfire.yml add

    bundle exec rake db:create

to your setup commands before running

    bundle exec rake db:migrate

or

    bundle exec rake db:schema:load

This will set up the database with the correct postgis extensions.

We autodetect the ***postgis*** gem and set up your database.yml
automatically.
