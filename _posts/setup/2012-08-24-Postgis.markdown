Setting up PostGIS on Railsonfire is extremely simple. All you need to
do is add the ***activerecord-postgis-adapter*** gem to your Gemfile.

Additionally in your railsonfire.yml add ***bundle exec rake
db:create*** to your setup commands before running ***bundle exec rake db:migrate*** or
***bundle exec rake db:schema:load***.
This will set up the database with the correct postgis extensions.

We autodetect the ***postgis*** gem and set up your database.yml
automatically.
