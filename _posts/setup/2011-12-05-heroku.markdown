Railsonfire is currently in the Heroku private beta. If you are part of the private beta program you can install our Addon. We will move to public beta and general availability in the next couple of weeks.

To start using Railsonfire as a Heroku Addon simply add it to one of your applications. If you are already signed up with the email you use with Heroku you will be logged into that account. If there is no User with that email it will be created and you will be logged in.

You can always login through the resources page of your Heroku Application.

The Heroku Addon provides a convenient way to create a new account. The rest of the interaction with Railsonfire is the same as for non Heroku accounts. To use Railsonfire for testing and deploying your code head over to [the How To add a new Project guide](/setup/Adding-a-project.html).
