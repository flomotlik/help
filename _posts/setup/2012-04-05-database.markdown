#### SQL Databases

If you use MySQL or PostgreSQL Railsonfire automatically detects the gems in your Gemfile and sets database.yml accordingly.

For example if you have either of those gems in your Gemfile

    gem 'pg'
    gem 'mysql2'

one of the following files will be copied to config/database.yml

* [MySQL.](/files/rof-mysql-database.yml)
* [PostgreSQL.](/files/rof-postgres-database.yml)

#### NoSQL
Railsonfire currently supports MongoDB, Redis and Memcache. All of them run on default ports. Connecting to MongoDB, Redis and Memcache shouldn't need any further configuration than the defaults.
