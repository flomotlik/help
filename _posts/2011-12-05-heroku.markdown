To start using Railsonfire as a Heroku Addon simply add it to one of your applications. A new User will be created for use with this specific app.

You can always login through the resources page of your Heroku Application.

The Heroku Addon provides a convenient way to create a new account. The rest of the interaction with Railsonfire is the same as for non Heroku accounts. To use Railsonfire for testing and deploying your code head over to [the How To add a new Project guide](/setup/Adding-a-project.html).
