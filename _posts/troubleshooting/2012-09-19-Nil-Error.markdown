If you ever encounter an error similar to

    undefined method `strip' for nil:NilClass

or any other error during your initialization that it may be that you
forgot the set ENV variables, but refer to them during your
initialisation.

Check the file where the error occurs and see if it references and ENV
and check if you set it with our [ENV variable support](/setup/setting-env-vars.html).
